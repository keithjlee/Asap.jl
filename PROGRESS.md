# Asap v1.0 Modernization — Progress

> Live checklist, updated as work lands. Plan: `docs/MODERNIZATION.md`. Branch: `modernization/phase-0` (main untouched).

## Phase 0 — Hygiene & characterization ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] CLAUDE.md for Asap, AsapOptim, AsapToolkit, AsapHarmonics
- [x] Approved plan committed as `docs/MODERNIZATION.md`
- [x] CI workflow (Julia 1.10 LTS + latest, ubuntu + macos); julia compat → 1.10
- [x] Characterization fixtures pinning exact v0.2.2 numerics (94): Kassimali textbook models, portal frames × all 5 releases, per-release q()/q_local()/local_K/global_K/R oracles on a skewed element
- [x] GravityLoad bug documented as `@test_broken`
- [x] AsapToolkit InternalForces oracles (84; joist point-load combo skipped — Toolkit catalog gap)
- [x] DiffAnalysis_2024 publication golden fixtures (16): all 4 paper structures serialized + rebuilt + verified with plain Asap (0.2.1 ≡ 0.2.2 at rtol 1e-9); Zygote gradients at x_init for S4.1/S4.2 (Phase 5a AD oracle)
- [x] DemandTransport2 added to migration scope (Phase 5d) + downstream AD contract documented
- [x] Documentation standard codified (FormaSlab-style docstrings + ShowMethods.jl)
- [x] Branch policy: main = stable v0.2.x; all work on `modernization/*`

**Suite status: 6 legacy + 113 characterization passing, 1 expected broken (GravityLoad).**

### Notable findings during Phase 1 (see commit messages for detail)
- Legacy `q_local(::PointLoad)` splits axial FEF 50/50 regardless of position — physics bug, replaced by consistent lever-rule distribution (documented deviation in docs/MODERNIZATION.md).
- DOF activity must be decided per node rotation *block* in global coordinates (Λ mixes torsion with bending rotations) — encoded in `dof_signature`.
- Legacy `planarize!(model, :XY)` also zeroes element Ψ — ported.
- Legacy Asap 0.2.1 (publication) ≡ 0.2.2 forward results verified at rtol 1e-9.

## Phase 1 — Core rework ✅ COMPLETE

Order is bottom-up; each layer validated against Phase 0 oracles before the next.

- [x] `Material{T}` + `AbstractSection{T}` accessor contract (EA/EIx/EIy/GJ/ρA) + `Section{T}` + `RigiditySection{T}` — with full docstrings + show methods
- [x] `Node{T}` (SVector position, 6-DOF fixity; TrussNode absorbed)
- [x] `EndSprings{T}`/`EndConditions{T}` + release symbol map
- [x] Element kernels: `local_frame` (transformation), fixity-factor stiffness (Monforton–Wu), validated against pinned `local_K`/`R` oracles at release limits
- [x] Element structs: `FrameElement{T,S}`, `TrussElement{T,S}` + element interface (`dof_signature`, `ndofs`, …)
- [x] `NodalSpring{T}` (applicative spring supports)
- [x] DOF layer: activity accumulation, free/fixed/inactive partition, internal-DOF blocks (internal blocks land with VariableElement)
- [x] Symbolic assembly (element groups, frozen pattern, nzmap; scatter matrix lands with pure path)
- [x] In-place numeric assembly + solve pipeline (`process!`/`solve!`, cached factorization)
- [x] `LinearResults{T}` + accessors + element-wise reactions
- [x] Pure functional path (`ModelState`, `assemble_K`, `solve`) + `ext/AsapChainRulesExt.jl` (3 rrules)
- [x] Parity tests (pure ≡ in-place) + Zygote-vs-FiniteDiff gradient checks
- [x] `VariableElement{T}` via internal DOFs (bridgeprocessing deletion lands with the module flip)
- [x] Characterization suite green on new core — **module flipped**: legacy deleted, Asap IS the v1.0 core, 2347 tests green, version 1.0.0-DEV

## Phase 2 — Loads ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Gauss/Hermite FEF engine (exact for piecewise-linear intensities)
- [x] Canonical `DistributedLoad` + `LineLoad`/`PointLoad`/`SelfWeight`; case tags on all loads
- [x] Generic end-spring FEF condensation (replaces per-release q() catalog)
- [x] SelfWeight from ρA(section) — GravityLoad bug structurally impossible
- [x] `TrapezoidLoad` convenience constructor + `PointMoment` (derivative-Hermite kernel, classic-table verified)
- [x] Trapezoid FEFs cross-checked against exact polynomial-integration oracles + classic triangle tables
## Phase 3 — Force recovery (priority) ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] `LoadTrace` (merged local loads, jump-exact doubled breakpoints, cumulative ∫w / ∫w·s)
- [x] `ElementForceState` + zero-allocation scalar evaluators (`axial_force`/`shear_y`/`shear_z`/`torsion`/`moment_y`/`moment_z` at fraction t)
- [x] `InternalForces` dense sampling (breakpoints + both sides of point actions) — axis-correct names
- [x] Displacement recovery (`local_displacements`: exact double integration, classic deflection formulas verified)
- [x] VariableElement composite dispatch (`moment_z(model, el, t)` unified queries; interior continuity)
- [x] Validated against pinned AsapToolkit oracles across all portal releases under the documented rename map (tk.My→Mz, tk.Mz→−My, tk.P→N)
- [x] Property tests: dMz/dx=Vy, dMy/dx=−Vz, dVy/dx=w, exact jumps at point forces/moments
## Phase 4 — Cases/combos/envelopes ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] `solve_cases!`: per-case solves against ONE assembly + ONE factorization (multi-RHS)
- [x] `LoadCombination` + `combine`: factored results by pure superposition — verified ≡ brute-force factored solves (u, reactions, forces, compliance, recovery diagrams)
- [x] Combination-aware recovery (`internal_forces(...; results, factors)`)
- [x] `envelope`: station-wise extrema over combinations at common stations (all-cases-on station set so no combo's jumps are missed) — verified ≡ brute-force extrema
- [x] Single-factorization reuse proven in tests
## Phase 5 — Ecosystem migration 🔄

### 5a AsapOptim ✅ COMPLETE (branch `asap-v1` in ../AsapOptim)
- [x] Rewritten as a ~600-line Zygote-free design-vector layer on the core pure path (was 2400 lines of parallel implementation + hand-written adjoints)
- [x] Unified `OptParams` (Truss/Frame aliases); Spatial/Area/Coupled variables with sparse scatter compilation
- [x] `solve_structure`/`axial_force`/`axial_stress`/`compliance`/`GeometricProperties`/`updatemodel`
- [x] First-ever AsapOptim test suite: 28 tests, gradcheck vs FiniteDifferences, design-eval ≡ direct solve
- [x] Legacy preserved unloaded in `legacy_v0/`
- [ ] Deferred: FDM network optimization path; SectionVariable (RigiditySection parameterization is the v1.0 idiom)

### 5b AsapToolkit ✅ PORTED (branch `asap-v1`) — visual verification pending
- [x] ForceAnalysis/ deleted (absorbed into core); generators/Geometry/IO/SteelSections/FDM-translations ported
- [x] Frame generator: BridgeElement joists → explicit interior nodes; releases now actually applied (legacy passed them as the id positional — silently ignored!)
- [x] ElementDisplacements reimplemented on core displacement recovery
- [x] First test suite: 58 tests (generator smoke + equilibrium, displaced shape vs core, section bridges)
- [ ] Keith: regenerate a few reference plots side-by-side (visual check); AsapSections WIP left uncommitted

### 5c AsapHarmonics ✅ PORTED (branch `asap-v1`)
- [x] Rename pass complete; first test suite (3D spherical + planar 2D signatures, finite feature vectors)

### 5d DemandTransport2 🔄 IN PROGRESS (branch `asap-v1`; package src only)
- Package src port + first test suite (agent running); example scripts (highrise/vault) ported interactively later
- Vault example blocked on the deferred AsapOptim network-optimization path

## Deferred / follow-ups
- FDM network optimization path in AsapOptim (legacy_v0/ reference)
- SectionVariable → RigiditySection parameterization idiom
- FDM subsystem parametrization in core
- Geometric nonlinearity (`geometric_stiffness` hook ready), dynamics (`mass` hook ready)
- Enzyme/Mooncake/DifferentiationInterface matrix on the pure path
- Docs build (Documenter.jl) from the extensive docstrings
